P for Predictions,

R for Reveries,

P for Possibilities,

K for Kaleidoscope of ideas.

Just kidding. prpk.com is only a storyless domain name registered by my father 20 years ago. When 4-letter domain names were using up, he randomly hit his keyboard, and that was the birth of prpk.com. It could have been nwsc.com or eodk.com.

Of course, none of these sites is available, because they came from me randomly typing on my keyboard as well. There are great sites like xkcd.com, and believe it or not, I discovered it through randomly typing on my keyboard when I was only 12!
