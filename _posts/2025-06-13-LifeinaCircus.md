title: "Life in a Circus"
---
Starring at the iron ring, burning with fire, I was wondering about my life in the circus. The crowd was screaming and shouting behind me, just like years before, when I first got on the stage. Although the noise was quite annoying and tiresome, peopleâ€™s screaming seemed quite enjoying for me. It made me feel proud and relax, and also represents an enjoyable life, a life with substantial food and a cozy bed. I jumped through the fire, easily and elegant.

I was put into the cage after the performance was over. The night was dark, and storm was raging outside the huge tent of the circus. Lighting flashed through the darkness, just like the devil teared an abyss on the curtain of the sky, coincided with a terrible bang sound and wind roaring through the leaking tent. Rain fell inside the tent, leaving stains on the ground. I starred at the iron handrail, wondering through my memory, wondering about my current life. 

The lightning flash through the dark curtain again, leaving a deafening sound, like a bomb exploded in a broad plain. After the lighting was gone, however, something unfamiliar to me appeared on the fissure on the tent. It was a crow, with wringing feathers and a pair of tired, untidy wings, looking like a ship losing in the stormy ocean for hours, finding an island just for a safety port to stay. Its head lowed to the ground, and water dropped from the body, leaving a small piece of wet space. 

Lighting struck the continent again, striking on the soul of mine at the same time. The crow was resting on a small branch inside the tent now, and it looked much more livable. Its feather was dry now, and its head steeved up, just like a hero, and jumped into the stormy weather again. I finally found out the missing part in my soul: freedom. I lived inside the cozy cage for years, never enjoyed the happiness of freedom, and now, it was the time for me to escape from the cozy cage and the burning ring, and fought for my freedom.

I dashed outside the cage, without looking back, hurrying into the strom and the rain.
