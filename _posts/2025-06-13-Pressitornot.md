title: "Press it or not"

Jack was sitting in his old house, reading an ancient sci-fi called the Dragon Egg (A novel about how aliens help humankind to explore in the universe) in the somber light of a dying candle. The sun sank beside the horizon of the world, and the city outside the window was nearly dark, without lights and shadows. Jack stood up from his rusty old chair, which made a creaking sound, like an old man running out of strength. He picked up a new candle, and put it on the table. 

The room was full of orange, peaceful light now and we could finally get a full view of the room. It was an old and rusty place, with cracks on the walls and ceilings, and rotten wooden floor with smells of dead animals. On the northern side of the room, there was a paper calendar, writing “Sep 2nd, 2133”. Jack was sitting next to the table, relaxing his arms and shoulders, reading a paper-made books, putting his hands on a huge red button sticking on the chair. Outside the window, it was completely dark now and you could hardly believe there was a city. 

“Knock, knock.” The door made a terrible noise, seems like it would collapse in no time. A man with straight military uniform came in with a piece of glass on his hands, and he stood still in front of Jack. Jack seemed used to the visit of him, sitting on the chair with a black expression, even without looking up at the man. The man touched something on the glass, and it opened with blue light, showing a holograph of an eight-feet monster.

“Octpolians,” The man said with a low voice, “an evil creature which invaded thousands of stars and planets. Unfortunately, they are approaching the solar system with a great speed, and within 24 hours, the earth and all the living things on it will be swallowed by them. And now, would you lik…” 

Jack interrupted the man rudely: “You have been told me about the stupid eight-feet monster for over a hundred of time. I believe that I’ve told you for a hundred time that I’m not interested in drifting in the universe and jumping from stars to stars. Now, please get out from the fucking room and leave me alone!” 

The man said nothing. He starred at Jack for a moment, and left the room with a sense of unbelievable and respectful. 

Outside the window, the night went by and the sun went up from the horizon. Beams of light shot inside room and covered it with dulcet golden curtain, covering the pages of the book with orange pigment. Jack opened the window and looked far into the sky: he could see a white tail rushing in the bright sky, moving rapidly. He knew it was the ships of Octpolians, and he went back into the room, pressed the button without hesitation.
